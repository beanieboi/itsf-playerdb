open questions
    - versioning with sqlite?
    - or rather: versioning via hand-crafted database scheme?

what do we need?
    - sqlite interface
    - webserver with auth
    - proxy logic
    - database format

web server
    - actix-web
    - need to test whether CORS works for a server on a different port/host?
        -> if so, it means that we can mix the rust standalone and the C# UI

rendering HTML
    - server-side: "HTML templating", e.g. https://maud.lambda.xyz/control-structures.html
    - client-side: Seed/Yew

Scraping
    ITSF:
        - Images: https://media.fast4foos.org/photos/players/[NUMBER].jpg
        - can scrape world rankings by season: https://www.tablesoccer.org/page/player?tour=[YEAR]&numlic=[NUMBER]
    BuLi:
        - can probably just scrape the DTFL website? or maybe get some info from DTFB?
